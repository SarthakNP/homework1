What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
In simple terms, a merge combines changes from one branch into another, creating a new "merge commit" that shows the history of both branches. It keeps the original branch's commit history intact but can result in a more cluttered timeline. On the other hand, a rebase moves the entire branch to a new starting point, essentially rewriting its history. It replays the branch's commits on top of the target branch, creating a cleaner, linear history but potentially altering the order of commits.
